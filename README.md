## Description 

Bandwich is a simple 4-track interface built with collaboration in mind. A Bandwich audio workstation can be used to share song ideas between users or collaborate on audio tracks. The project utilizes [Recorder.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs) to record audio files in the browser and stores the Base64 data in a SQL database.

The workstation follows the same functionality of a classic 4 track tape recorder. To those not familiar with recording DAWs here is a walkthrough:
